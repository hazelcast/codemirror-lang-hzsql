This package implements HzSQL language support for the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/6/) code editor.

This repository is forked from [codemirror/lang-sql](https://github.com/codemirror/lang-sql).

Hazelcast Management Center uses this package to support highlighting/code completion in SQL Browser pages.

Ideally at every Hazelcast release, one should mirror the language changes to the grammar defined by this repository (and also merge the changes from the upstream declared above.)
